# Cinematrix

A web application for recommending movies.

## Project Description

“Netflix” app developed by me and fellow students at NTNU in the course TDT4140 during spring 2024. Follow the instructions below for setup. My team and I worked on developing a product by applying agile methodologies, particularly Scrum. The course was carefully designed to simulate a real working environment, which provided us with valuable experience in modern development practices and collaboration techniques.

Cinematrix is a web application for tracking movies you have watched as well as parts about them that you enjoyed. You can rate movies, favorite genres, actors, directors and so on. The application will use this information to give recommendations for good movie candidates to choose from for your next film experience. We also offer the ability to filter through a database of movies in case the recommendations just aren't hitting right.

## Getting started

If you do not have **Node.js**, install that using nvm:

```bash
nvm install node
```

Then, navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To run the application; run the (development) server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.
